# Control
Control is a simple and lightweight SmartHome App that runs on HomeAssistant. It's designed to be an alternative to the clunky default HASS frontend.
However, it is not a replacement for the default frontend, but rather a complement to it since it does not provide all the features of the default frontend.
Control's development will also always prioritize the usage of Lights and Switches, since these are the most common devices in a SmartHome.
